# PlayableSpade

IMPORTANT:
The mod is not yet complete, and contains:

    Bugs
    Missing animations
    Placeholder assets and sounds
    Missing features

Any instances of wrong animation playing mean that the intended animation is missing and are not a bug.

PLEASE backup your saves before messing around with the mod. It should not affect them, but it would be wise to back them up regardless. You can also use the separate profile feature of mod manager.

As updates come out, old saves made with beta builds might become incompatible or broken.

Currently:

    Spade can finish a Classic Mode playtrough.
    Attack, air and ground specials are complete.
    Air dash is working, and has been redesigned to fit FP2 playstyle. FP1 styled dash has been tested and was not as good as it looks.


How to play as Spade:

Make a new Classic* Mode save, on character select Spade.
The newly created save file will let you play the whole game as Spade.

    Dash is bound to guard button. You can dash once in the air, aiming it with movement buttons.
    Attack throws set of 3 cards, you can aim them in 6 directions.
    Ground Special throws 3 Capture Cards stolen from Dail's armoury to home in on the nearest enemies
    Air Special throws a wave of cards towards the ground propelling you in the opposite direction. It does not limit your horizontal speed, it does lock your vertical height.


*Or Adventure, it will play broken or no cutscenes however. Due to missing a cutscene you cannot progress past Battlesphere.
